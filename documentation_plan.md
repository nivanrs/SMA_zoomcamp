## Detailed Plan Steps:

1.  **Create a new top-level `docs/` directory** to house all generated documentation.
2.  **Create `docs/README.md` (Project Overview):**
    - Summarize the overall purpose and goals of the "Stock Market Analytics Zoomcamp."
    - Highlight key features and what learners can expect to gain.
    - Link to the official GitHub repository and PythonInvest website.
3.  **Create `docs/SYLLABUS.md` (Course Syllabus):**
    - Provide a detailed breakdown of each module, expanding on the short syllabus from the main README.
    - List the learning objectives for each module.
    - Include links to the module-specific documentation files.
4.  **Create `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md`:**
    - Outline prerequisites (e.g., basic Python knowledge).
    - Provide clear instructions for setting up the environment (e.g., Colab, local Jupyter, virtual environments, Ta-lib installation from Module 5 README).
    - Explain how to access course materials (YouTube, slides, Colab notebooks).
5.  **Create `docs/MODULE_01.md` to `docs/MODULE_05.md` (Module-Specific Documentation):**
    - For each module:
      - Summarize the module's content.
      - List key concepts covered.
      - Provide direct links to the YouTube recordings, slides, and Colab notebooks for both 2024 and 2025 cohorts (if applicable).
      - Mention the homework assignments and where to find them.
      - For Module 5, include the "Local Automation Instructions" in detail.
6.  **Create `docs/PROJECT.md` (Project Guidelines):**
    - Describe the final project's purpose.
    - Outline the project timeline (Week 1 & 2 for working, Week 3 for reviewing).
    - Mention where to find project-related materials (e.g., `projects/README.md`).
7.  **Create `docs/COMMUNITY_SUPPORT.md`:**
    - Detail how to get support (Slack channel, Telegram).
    - Include the Slack community guidelines and recommendations for asking questions.
    - Link to the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document.
    - Link to PythonInvest's YouTube channel and other relevant resources.
8.  **Review and Refine:**
    - Ensure consistency in formatting and terminology.
    - Check all links for correctness.
    - Verify that all essential information from the original READMEs and module READMEs is captured.
    - Add a table of contents to each markdown file for easy navigation.
