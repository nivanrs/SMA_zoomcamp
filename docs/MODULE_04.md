# Module 4: Trading Strategy and Simulation

This module moves beyond prediction into the practical realm of trading strategy and simulation, covering key features of strategies, various examples, and simulating financial results.

## Module Summary

Module 4 explores the realm of trading strategy and simulation. It optionally guides on how to start trading (from downloading an app to placing a trade). The module uncovers key features of trading strategies, including considerations like trading fees, risk management, combining predictions, and timing of market entry. It delves into various strategy examples such as single stock investment, diversified portfolio optimization, market-neutral strategies, mean reversion, vertical stocks covering, pairs trading, "Penny" stocks, and dividend strategies. An advanced section on basic options strategy is also mentioned. Finally, the module covers simulating financial results based on predictions and the chosen strategy.
