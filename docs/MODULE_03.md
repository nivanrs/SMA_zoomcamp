# Module 3: Analytical Modeling

This module focuses on framing hypotheses and unraveling time-series predictions, covering various modeling techniques including regression, binary classification, and an optional introduction to neural networks.

## Module Summary

Module 3 delves into framing hypotheses and unraveling time-series predictions. It covers heuristics and hand rules for practical predictions, predicting time-series data by analyzing trends, seasonality, and remainder decomposition. The module also explores regression techniques for understanding data relationships, binary classification to determine growth direction, and includes an optional example of neural networks in analytical modeling.
