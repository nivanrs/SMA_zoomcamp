# Module 5: Deployment and Automation

This module focuses on streamlining processes from prediction to action, covering the transition to Python files, persistent storage, automation techniques, and systematic execution of predictions and trades.

## Module Summary

Module 5 focuses on streamlining processes from prediction to action. It covers the transition from Colab notebooks to Python files for improved deployment and execution, establishing persistent storage mechanisms (including files and potentially a simple SQLite database with an introduction to SQL). The module explores automation techniques such as scheduling cron jobs for a series of `.py` files and considering data workflow solutions like Apache Airflow. Learners will also learn to generate predictions and execute trades systematically, with an optional advanced section on implementing automated email notifications containing predictions, trade details, and profit/loss updates.

## Key Concepts Covered

- Transitioning from Colab notebooks to Python files for deployment
- Persistent storage mechanisms (files, SQLite, SQL introduction)
- Automation techniques:
  - Scheduling cron jobs
  - Data workflow solutions (e.g., Apache Airflow)
- Systematic generation of predictions
- Automated trade execution
- (Maybe - Advanced) Automated email notifications for financial updates

## Hands-on Exercises and Notebooks

  - _Note:_ It is recommended to clone the repository to a local machine and view via Jupyter Notebook or open directly from [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/) as GitHub's UI may truncate the code and output.
