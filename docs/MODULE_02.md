# Module 2: Working with Data (in Pandas)

This module focuses on the essential Python libraries for data analysis, covering data types, manipulation, feature generation, cleaning strategies, and descriptive analysis using Pandas.

## Module Summary

Module 2 explores the core libraries for data analysis in Python: Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib (including Seaborn and Plotly Express). It delves into various data types (numeric, string, date), mastering the art of generating dummy variables, and enhancing datasets with feature generation techniques such as deriving hour/day of the week and growth over different periods. The module also covers incorporating technical indicators using the TaLib library, understanding predictive elements, effective data cleaning strategies, joining multiple datasets, and conducting thorough descriptive analysis to uncover meaningful insights and correlations.

## Key Concepts Covered

- Core Python libraries for data analysis (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly Express)
