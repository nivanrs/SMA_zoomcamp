### Guidelines for Asking for Help in Slack

To ensure discussions in Slack are organized and effective, please follow these recommendations:

- **Before Posting:**
  - Try to Google your question first.
  - Check the Course's FAQ ([Frequently asked technical questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ABQD6ns4vZHKu2dHG9B7irveRASJCAS4BTnJcvM2QX2ykIGZ0UNgCPQ/edit?usp=sharing)) before posting.
- **When Posting:**
  - **DO NOT** use screenshots, especially do not take pictures from a phone. Copy and paste errors directly. If the error message is long, post it as a reply to your thread.
  - **DO NOT** tag instructors directly; this may discourage others from helping you.
  - Use triple backticks (```) for formatting your code snippets.
  - Use the same thread for the entire conversation related to an issue (reply to your own thread).
  - **DO NOT** create multiple posts to discuss the same issue.
  - You may create a new post if an issue re-emerges later, but be sure to describe what has changed in the environment since the last discussion.
  - Provide additional information in the same thread about the steps you have already taken for resolution.
